# UI8Kit

A modern, clean, and efficient UI component library blending the strengths of shadcn/ui theming, Mantine-style props, and an 8px design grid for pixel-perfect, scalable interfaces.

## 🎯 Philosophy
UI8Kit prioritizes **clarity over complexity**, delivering a pure design foundation without overwhelming gradients, animations, or decorations. Focus on typography, spacing, and content hierarchy for timeless, minimalist UIs.

### The Three Pillars
- **🔧 shadcn/ui Theming**: Modern CSS variables, Tailwind integration, automatic dark mode, and HSL color system.
- **📏 Mantine Props Consistency**: Intuitive APIs, TypeScript safety, and composable components.
- **🎨 8px Design Grid System**: Consistent spacing, harmonious typography, and scalable visual hierarchy.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Clean Design System**: Minimalist aesthetics with subtle shadows and borders.
- **🌙 Theme System**: Built-in themes (LesseUI, ModernUI, SkyOS), dark/light mode, and localStorage persistence.
- **🧩 Component Architecture**: Core components like Button, Card, Stack, Grid; semantic Typography; flexible Layouts.
